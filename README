MEItoVexFlow
============

A JavaScript library which provides a function for converting MEI
<http://music-encoding.org/> encoded music notation into drawing
instructions for the VexFlow <http://vexflow.com/> music notation
rendering library.

Usage
-----

The library provides the function `render_notation` which takes four
arguments:

 - `score` should be a markup fragment containing the MEI

 - `target` should be an HTML <canvas> element onto which the notation
   will be drawn

 - `width` should be the width of the canvas (optional)

 - `height` should be the height of the canvas (optional)

The function has been tested using an MEI fragment embedded within an
HTML document. See:
http://igor.gold.ac.uk/~map01rl/pocac/prokofiev-op-36.html

Dependencies
------------

Any browser in which this code is used must have the VexFlow and
jQuery libraries loaded.

Limitations
-----------

Only a small subset of MEI has so far been implemented. Many
conventional aspects of common practice notation have been igonred
(such as repeat accidentals, stem directions). It's also important to
remember that VexFlow is a moving target, it's in constant development
and so this code could break at any time.
